the contents of src/ are as follows:
remarks.md: various notes from development
func-naive: naive, non-Montgomery arithmetic implementation (buggy, slow!)
func-mm:    functional Montgomery implementation
opt:        software optimised implementation
asm:        optimised implementation, with handwritten assembly at bottleneck
stats:      gprof stats files (plaintext) from various steps of development

to run the tests in each of the code folders, test.sh and test_gmon.sh, you will
need:
awk
gprof
openssl
qemu-arm
arm-linux-gnueabi-gcc (to build)
