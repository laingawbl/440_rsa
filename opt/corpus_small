Gloucester. Now is the winter of our discontent
	Made glorious summer by this sun of York;
	And all the clouds that lour'd upon our house
	In the deep bosom of the ocean buried.
	Now are our brows bound with victorious wreaths;
	Our bruised arms hung up for monuments;
	Our stern alarums chang'd to merry meetings,
	Our dreadful marches to delightful measures.
	Grim-visag'd war hath smooth'd his wrinkled front,
	And now, instead of mounting barbed steeds
	To fright the souls of fearful adversaries,
	He capers nimbly in a lady's chamber
	To the lascivious pleasing of a lute.
